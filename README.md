RistrettoExample
================

Example of prototyping with Ristretto

You need PHP, [Node.js with NPM](http://nodejs.org) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ViliamKopecky/RistrettoExample.git
cd RistrettoExample
npm install
grunt
```

When you see `Gruntfile.js` config - you will see, that Ristretto is configured to serve on port 2013.

So in your browser open [http://localhost:2013/](http://localhost:2013/) and Ristretto should welcome you in the example.

`// The first request will probably take some minute. Because on the background there is [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) updating. When it's done, just refresh and enjoy!
